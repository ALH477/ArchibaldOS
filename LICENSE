ArchibaldOS License Document
Licensing Information
ArchibaldOS is a free and open-source operating system derived from CachyOS. As a modification of CachyOS, which is presumed to be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), ArchibaldOS is also distributed under the same license. The GPLv3 is a free software license created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to ensure that software remains open, accessible, and modifiable by all users. This document explains the key aspects of the GPLv3 and its implications for users and developers of ArchibaldOS.

A full copy of the GNU General Public License version 3 can be found at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html or included with the distribution of ArchibaldOS.

What is the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)?
The GPLv3 is a "copyleft" license, meaning that any software distributed under it—including derivative works like ArchibaldOS—must also be licensed under the same terms. This ensures that the software remains free and open for everyone. Because ArchibaldOS is a modification of CachyOS, it inherits the GPLv3 license, preserving the freedoms granted by the original software.

Freedoms Granted to Users
Under the GPLv3, users of ArchibaldOS are granted the following rights:

Freedom to Run: You may use ArchibaldOS for any purpose, without restrictions.
Freedom to Study and Modify: You have access to the source code and the right to study how ArchibaldOS works and modify it to suit your needs.
Freedom to Redistribute: You can share copies of ArchibaldOS with others.
Freedom to Distribute Modified Versions: You may create and distribute your own modified versions of ArchibaldOS.
However, there is an important condition: if you distribute ArchibaldOS or any modified versions of it, you must do so under the GPLv3 license. This ensures that all recipients of the software receive the same freedoms you have.

Implications for Developers
If you are a developer contributing to ArchibaldOS or creating derivative works based on it, your contributions must also be licensed under the GPLv3. This requirement keeps the entire project—and any future modifications—open and free for all users. The source code for your contributions must be made available under the same terms as ArchibaldOS itself.

Key Features of GPLv3 Relevant to ArchibaldOS
The GPLv3 includes several provisions that enhance its protections for users and developers of ArchibaldOS:

Patent Protection: The license provides an explicit patent grant, meaning that contributors to ArchibaldOS cannot use patents to restrict users’ rights. This helps safeguard the software from patent litigation.
Anti-Tivoization: The GPLv3 prevents manufacturers from locking down devices (e.g., through hardware restrictions) to stop users from running modified versions of the software. This ensures that you can install and use modified versions of ArchibaldOS on compatible hardware.
License Compatibility: The GPLv3 is compatible with certain other open-source licenses, such as the Apache License 2.0. If ArchibaldOS incorporates code from projects under compatible licenses, those components can coexist within the GPLv3 framework.
